To run this Wordle game script, open a terminal in the directory where the script is saved. To simulate multiple games automatically, use the command 
`python game.py --r <number>`, replacing `<number>` with the desired count of games (e.g., `python game.py --r 10` to simulate 10 games). 
The script will then display the percentage of correctly guessed words and the average number of guesses at the end of the simulations.
